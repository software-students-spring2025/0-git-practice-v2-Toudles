# An article about software engineering I found interesting: https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2024/12/30/10-key-ways-software-engineers-are-using-ai/

I found this article interesting because of how prevalent AI is becoming in our daily lives. It definitely is rapidly evolving and as someone struggling to get internships and getting into the CS scene late, rather than fearing AI and being scared it's going to "take all our jobs", I like to stay optimistic and think, "how can we use it as a tool to help us create even more advanced things"? Just because AI is advancing at a rapid pace doesn't mean we can't either and i think this article is a good representation of how we don't have to fear AI but rather have it on our side and use it as a tool of development for anything we want in this world.

I agree with your perspective that AI should be viewed as a tool to help facilitate completing our tasks in a more efficient way. One of my friends is student teaching this year, and his schools have been exploring how to use AI as an educational tool which I think is really interesting. It is also exciting from a SWE perspective because there are many new jobs focused solely on the development of AI at many companies. I'm definitely interested in seeing how AI continues to integrate itself into our society.
