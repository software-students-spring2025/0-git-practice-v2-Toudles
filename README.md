# An article about software engineering I found interesting: https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2024/12/30/10-key-ways-software-engineers-are-using-ai/

I found this article interesting because of how prevalent AI is becoming in our daily lives. It definitely is rapidly evolving and as someone struggling to get internships and getting into the CS scene late, rather than fearing AI and being scared it's going to "take all our jobs", I like to stay optimistic and think, "how can we use it as a tool to help us create even more advanced things"? Just because AI is advancing at a rapid pace doesn't mean we can't either and i think this article is a good representation of how we don't have to fear AI but rather have it on our side and use it as a tool of development for anything we want in this world.

I think you perspective is a good one to have which is supported by the Forbes article which considers all of the benefits of AI and how prevalent it is. I think it is good to take an optimistic approach to the prevlance of AI and focus on the opportunities AI brings instead of what it may take away. On that note, I have seen some argue that AI increases the need for software engineers, whether or not that may be true.
